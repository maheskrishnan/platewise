# The 7-Meal Rotation: The Last Diet You’ll Ever Need

How to get lean, stay lean, and never think about food again.

I’ve tried every diet under the sun — keto, carnivore, IIFYM, meal-prep-hell, 6-meals-of-chicken-broccoli-and-rice…  
They all work. For about 6–12 weeks. Then you burn out, rebound, and hate yourself.

There is exactly **one method** that actually works forever, and it’s the one used by 95 % of naturally lean people (fitness models, doctors, busy parents, CEOs) who stay 8–15 % body fat year-round without tracking apps or misery.

It’s called the **7-Meal Rotation** (sometimes called “the shortlist diet”).

### What It Is (in one sentence)
Pick 7 high-protein meals you genuinely enjoy → eat only those 7 meals, in any order you want, for the rest of your life.

That’s it. No points, no macros after week 1, no forbidden foods list longer than your arm.

### Why It Works Better Than Anything Else

| Problem with most diets              | How 7-Meal Rotation fixes it                              |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Decision fatigue (“what do I eat today?”) | Zero decisions after the first week                      |
| Boredom & burnout                    | 7 different meals = enough variety to stay sane forever   |
| Inconsistent calories/macros         | All 7 meals are engineered to be almost identical in macros |
| Social life gets destroyed           | Eating out? Pick the closest thing to one of your 7 meals |
| Weekend cheating & rebound           | There is no “cheat” because the plan is already enjoyable |

### Real-World Proof
- Natural physique athletes: 7–10 rotating meals
- The Rock (off-season): ~8 rotating meals
- My leanest clients (5+ years maintaining abs): all use 5–9 rotating meals
- People who eat the exact same meal every single day: usually quit after contest prep

### How to Build Your Own 7-Meal Rotation in One Afternoon

1. **List foods you already love** that are naturally high-protein and not junk.  
   Example: chicken, salmon, eggs, Greek yogurt, lean beef, turkey, cottage cheese, whey, rice, potatoes, oats, fruit, vegetables.

2. **Turn them into 7 complete meals** that each have ~40–65 g protein and fit your calorie target.  
   (Use MyFitnessPal or Cronometer just once to dial the portions.)

3. **Cook/prep everything on Sunday** (or don’t — many people cook daily, it still works).

4. **Live the rest of your life eating only those 7 meals** — mix and match however you feel.

### My Personal 7-Meal Rotation (82 kg / 180 lb male, stays ~10 % body fat year-round)

1. Chicken & rice bowl
2. Turkey stir-fry
3. Baked salmon + sweet potato
4. Overnight protein oats
5. Giant egg-white + oat scramble
6. Lean beef & broccoli rice
7. Post-workout shake + banana + oats

That’s it. I’ve eaten variations of these 7 meals almost every day for 8+ years. Never bored, never fat.

### The 30-Day Challenge (Zero Risk)
For the next 30 days, eat **only** your 7 chosen meals.  
If you don’t look leaner, feel better, and have more mental energy at the end, I’ll buy you dinner.

It’s literally impossible to fail if you just don’t eat outside your list.
